## Summary 

This is a take-home project as part of an interview process. I was given the option of two different APIs to use, and I decided to go with the ![punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2). This app meets the following requirements:

1. Single page that displays beer options
2. Simple shopping cart implementation that allows users to add beer to their cart
3. Cart should be viewable by user

I've also added the ability for the user to search beer by name and view additional details about each beer by clicking on them.


## Installation

1. Fork and clone the repo to your local machine.
2. CD into repo and open in your code editor.
3. Install packages.
    ```zsh
    npm i
    ```
4. Start the application.
